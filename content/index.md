# Hi, I’m Adam!

I’m a software engineering who gets excited about maintainable code, pixel-perfect user interfaces, and high-quality user experiences. I’m an engineering lead at [Canny](https://canny.io/) and prior to that I was an engineering lead at [Versett](https://versett.com/). I spend my free time in the Canadian Rockies.
