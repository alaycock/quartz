2024 was a year of recovery. My Mt Louis accident was an undercurrent this year, though dealing with trauma and finding my way back into the outdoors.

My typical ascent of Ha Ling in early January was a positive indicator for my hiking ability, although it was apparent that skiing was not an option. My test days on the Sunshine ski out were painful and I dismissed the idea of skiing until the upcoming next winter. Despite my patience and physio, my ski attempt in December was also a bust. Perhaps my ankle surgery this year will help.

The benchmark of “500 meters elevation gain” used to be my benchmark to determine wether or not an outing made it onto my list. This year, any day out with Calvin was considered to be worthwhile of tracking. My total adventure days this year was a bit inflated, but a respectable 41. A far cry from my previous bests, but ankle recovery and taking care of Calvin is a reasonable excuse.

I attempted two 11ers and summited one, Victoria North was saved for another day. Assiniboine felt like a lifetime achievement and I summiting it on the anniversary of my accident the year before. Doing so was a questionable choice but definitely felt impactful at the time.

Other highlights include:  

- Opal North — A spectacular day out, I was surprised by the beauty of the ridge
- Mt Niles — A long and strenuous scramble but incredible glacial views from the summit
- Ha Ling — The sub 1-hour completion wasn’t a PB but was a recovery milestone
