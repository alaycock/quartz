Kicking off 2022, I thought I’d wrap up the hiking that I completed in the past year. Here are some key stats:

- Hiked 70 out of the 365 days in a year
- Covered 850 km distance
- Gained 57.3 km
- Started off the year right, with Ha Ling on January 1st, continuing the tradition
- Added one new 11-er to the list, Mt Edith Cavell
- Spent 17 days backpacking over 4 different trips
- Completed my first solo backpacking trip
- PB on Ha Ling: 51:47 to the summit — only to be beaten by Colton a few days later

Some stumbling blocks included:

- The “no-repeat hikes” goal — this stopped being a focus after realizing that some days it’s easier to get a workout than attempting something new. Especially when it comes to hiking with others and pets.
- The smoke. We didn’t attempt the Rundle traverse, and it gave us trouble on our other hikes throughout the summer.
- An overuse injury due to pushing myself too hard the last day of my Assiniboine trip. Taking an extra day would have saved me some pain and physiotherapy.
- Hiking in new areas — we mostly remained in the Bow Valley, in 2022 I’ll have to try to find more objectives further from home. I didn’t make it into the Ghost Wilderness area at all!
